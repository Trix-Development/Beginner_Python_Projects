#Basic arithmetic application 

# Two variable x and y will store two different numbers
x = 3
y = 7
n = 8
# Update number below by changing the value, you can change them by using the equals "=" x += 2 etc:
y = 19
x = 20
# Uses arithmetic operators to be able to do calculations with the two numbers
addition = x + y + n
subtraction = x - y - n
multiplication = x * y * n
divison = x / y 

# Order of operations BIDMAS(Brackets, Indices, divsion, multiplication, addition and subtration)
bidmas = (addition + multiplication) - divison * .00
print(bidmas)
